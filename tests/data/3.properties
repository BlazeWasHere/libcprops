# Proxy server system properties                          #
#---------------------------------------------------------#

# This system property specifies the proxy server host name
# and port number, specified in the format: hostName:portNumber
# The port number is optional.
com.ibm.as400.access.AS400.proxyServer=hqoffice

# This system property specifies how often, in seconds,
# the proxy server will look for idle connections. The
# proxy server starts a thread to look for clients that are
# no longer communicating. Use this property to set how
# often the thread looks for idle connections.
com.ibm.as400.access.TunnelProxyServer.clientCleanupInterval=7200

# This system property specifies how long, in seconds, a
# client can be idle before it is cleaned up. The proxy server
# starts a thread to look for clients that are no longer
# communicating. Use this property to set long a client can
# be idle before it is cleaned up.
com.ibm.as400.access.TunnelProxyServer.clientLifetime=2700

# Trace system properties                                 #
#---------------------------------------------------------#

# This system property specifies which trace categories to enable.
# This is a comma-delimited list containing any combination of trace
# categories.  The complete list of trace categories is defined in
# the Trace class.
com.ibm.as400.access.Trace.category=error,warning,information

# This system property specifies the file to which trace output
# is written.  The default is to write trace output to System.out.
com.ibm.as400.access.Trace.file=c:\\temp\\trace.out


#---------------------------------------------------------#
# Command Call system properties                          #
#---------------------------------------------------------#

# This system property specifies whether CommandCalls should 
# be assumed to be thread-safe. If true, all CommandCalls are 
# assumed to be thread-safe. If false, all CommandCalls are 
# assumed to be non-thread-safe. This property is ignored 
# for a given CommandCall object if either 
# CommandCall.setThreadSafe(true/false) or
# AS400.setMustUseSockets(true) has been performed on the object.
com.ibm.as400.access.CommandCall.threadSafe=true


#---------------------------------------------------------#
# Program Call system properties                          #
#---------------------------------------------------------#

# This system property specifies whether ProgramCalls should 
# be assumed to be thread-safe. If true, all ProgramCalls are 
# assumed to be thread-safe. If false, all ProgramCalls are 
# assumed to be non-thread-safe. This property is ignored 
# for a given ProgramCall object if either 
# ProgramCall.setThreadSafe(true/false) or
# AS400.setMustUseSockets(true) has been performed on the object.

#---------------------------------------------------------#
# FTP system properties                                   #
#---------------------------------------------------------#

# This system property specifies whether the socket is reused
# for multiple file transfers (through a single FTP instance),
# when in "active" mode.
# If true, the socket is reused. If false, a new socket is
# created for each file transfer.
# This property is ignored for a given FTP object if
# FTP.setReuseSocket(true/false) has been performed on the object.
com.ibm.as400.access.FTP.reuseSocket=true


#---------------------------------------------------------#
# Connection system properties                            #
#---------------------------------------------------------#

# This system property specifies the default signon handler.
# This property is ignored for a given AS400 object if
# AS400.setSignonHandler() has been performed on
# the object, or if AS400.setDefaultSignonHandler()
# has been called.
com.ibm.as400.access.AS400.signonHandler=mypackage.MyHandler


# This system property specifies whether the Toolbox should
# assume that the current environment has GUI capability.
# This property is ignored for a given AS400 object if
# AS400.setGuiAvailable() has been performed on the object.
com.ibm.as400.access.AS400.guiAvailable=true

# This system property specifies whether the appropriate
# secondary language library must be added to the library list,
# when running on the system. By default the library is not added.
# This property is ignored for a given AS400 object if
# AS400.setMustAddLanguageLibrary() has been performed
# on the object.
com.ibm.as400.access.AS400.mustAddLanguageLibrary=true

# This system property specifies whether sockets
# must be used when communicating with the system.
# Setting this property to true directs the Toolbox to refrain
# from exploiting native optimizations, when running directly on
# the system.
# By default, when running directly on the system the Toolbox
# will exploit native optimizations if they are available,
# and bypass sockets.
# This property is ignored for a given AS400 object if
# AS400.setMustUseSockets() has been performed on the object.
com.ibm.as400.access.AS400.mustUseSockets=true

# This system property specifies whether Internet domain sockets
# must be used when communicating with the system.
# Setting this property to true directs the Toolbox to refrain
# from exploiting Unix sockets, when running directly on
# the system.
# By default, when running directly on the system the Toolbox
# will exploit Unix sockets if they are available,
# rather than Internet domain sockets.
# This property is ignored for a given AS400 object if
# AS400.setMustUseNetSockets() has been performed on the object.
com.ibm.as400.access.AS400.mustUseNetSockets=true

# This system property specifies whether the explicitly supplied
# profile must be used when communicating with the system.
# Setting this property to true directs the Toolbox to
# refrain from exploiting the currently signed-on profile
# by default, when running directly on the system.
# This property is ignored for a given AS400 object if
# AS400.setMustUseSuppliedProfile() has been performed on the object.
com.ibm.as400.access.AS400.mustUseSuppliedProfile=true

# This system property specifies whether threads are used
# when communicating with the host servers.
# By default, the AS400 object creates separate threads
# to listen on communication sockets to the host servers.
# Setting this property to false directs the Toolbox to refrain
# from creating separate threads for host server communications.
# This property is ignored for a given AS400 object if
# AS400.setThreadUsed() has been performed on the object.
com.ibm.as400.access.AS400.threadUsed=true
